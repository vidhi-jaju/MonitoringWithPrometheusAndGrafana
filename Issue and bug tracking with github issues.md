# **Assignment: Understanding Bug Tracking & Issue Tracking with GitHub Issues**  

## **Objective**  
This assignment will help you understand how bug tracking and issue tracking systems work using **GitHub Issues** as an example. You will learn how to:  
1. Create and manage issues in GitHub.  
2. Label, assign, and prioritize issues.  
3. Track bug reports and feature requests.  
4. Understand workflows like triaging and closing issues.

## **Part 1: Understanding Bug Tracking & Issue Tracking**  

### **1. What is Bug Tracking?**  
- A system to log, monitor, and resolve software defects (bugs).  
- Helps developers track the status of bugs (e.g., Open, In Progress, Fixed).  

### **2. What is Issue Tracking?**  
- A broader system that includes:  
- Bug reports  
- Feature requests  
- Tasks  
- Improvements  

### **3. Why Use GitHub Issues?**  
- Built into GitHub (no extra setup needed).  
- Supports labels, milestones, assignees, and discussions.  
- Integrates with GitHub Projects for Kanban-style tracking.

## **Part 2: Hands-on Task with GitHub Issues**  

### **Task 1: Create a GitHub Repository (if you don’t have one)**  
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.  
2. Click **New** to create a repository (e.g., `bug-tracking-demo`).  

### **Task 2: Create Sample Issues**  
1. Go to the **Issues** tab in your repo.  
2. Click **New Issue**.  
3. Create **three different types of issues**:  
- **Bug Report** (e.g., "Login button not working")  
- **Feature Request** (e.g., "Add dark mode support")  
- **Task** (e.g., "Update documentation")  

### **Task 3: Use Labels, Assignees & Milestones**  
1. **Add Labels** (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).  
2. **Assign** the issue to yourself (or a teammate if collaborating).  
3. **Set a Milestone** (e.g., "Sprint 1" or "Version 1.0").  

### **Task 4: Simulate a Bug Fix Workflow**  
1. **Open** → **In Progress** → **Fixed** → **Closed**  
2. Add comments to track progress (e.g., "Reproduced the bug" → "Fixed in commit #abc123").  
3. **Close the issue** once resolved.  

### **Task 5: Use GitHub Projects (Optional)**  
1. Go to the **Projects** tab.  
2. Create a **Kanban board** with columns:  
- **To Do**  
- **In Progress**  
- **Done**  
3. Drag your issues into the appropriate columns.

## **Part 3: Questions for Reflection**  
1. What is the difference between a **bug report** and a **feature request**?  
2. Why is labeling important in issue tracking?  
3. How can milestones help in project management?  
4. What happens when an issue is closed? Can it be reopened?

## **Submission Guidelines**  
- **Option 1**: Share a link to your GitHub repo with the issues you created.  
- **Option 2**: Write a short report (1-2 pages) explaining your experience.  
- **Deadline**: [Specify if applicable]
